"""
This is the main driver for the simulation. The amount of state 
variables may make things a little difficult to follow, so I'll provide 
a more general overview. 

The idea is to break a day into some amount of timesteps, controlled by the 'seconds_per_timestep' variable. 
Basically all timing is based on this value. Then, we advance the simulation on each timestep and record
the results. 

The simulation loop is as follows: 
    1) Initialize state variables (things like the price of goods and the number of customers)
    2) Loop through all the timesteps for one day
        a) Update the employees (see employee.py for more info as to what that means)
        b) If there are free employees, and orders in the queue, assign an employee with an order 
        c) Calculate the chance that a customer will arrive 
            i) Depends on the likelyhood of a customer showing up that hour, 
                the length of the queue, and the price of the drinks 
        d) If a customer arrives, choose an order for them and add it to the queue 
    3) Save any statistics generated
    4) Repeat for however many days we are simulating
